# mpw-selectionmode-xcmd

Test for building a Classic macOS code resource on MacOS X using ksherlock's `mpw` tool.

## Requirements
You need a built version of the [`mpw` tool](https://github.com/ksherlock/mpw)
built according to the instructions in their Wiki.

To run it, you need any MacOS classic Mac or emulator (i.e. MacOS 9 or earlier).

## Line Endings
The C (.c, .h) and Rez (.r) source files use MacRoman encoding and MacOS line endings
(ASCII 13) which GitHub doesn't display correctly. View them as "Raw" to have your
browser show them correctly.
